# ObserverSearchResult

Inherits from: [SearchResult](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/search-result).

An `ObserverSearchResult` contains documents matched by a search query.  

This class is similar to a `SearchResult` except that every element of the `hits` array is an [Observer](/sdk/js/7/core-classes/observer).

A `ObserverSearchResult` instance is returned by [observe.search](/sdk/js/7/controllers/observe/search).
